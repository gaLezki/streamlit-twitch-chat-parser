# What

Tool to analyze chat activity peaks of Twitch broadcasts.

# Why

Helps to find clip-worthy moments without knowing anything about the broadcast.

# Who

I made this parser thing for csv files, but I have no affiliation with [Twitch Chat Downloader](https://www.twitchchatdownloader.com/) that creates csv exports from Twitch VOD links.

# How

First of all: I have no idea if this works with any mobile device. Wasn't developed for those, so might work or not.

1. Use [Twitch Chat Downloader](https://www.twitchchatdownloader.com/) to get csv export.
2. Upload it to this tool [here](https://parse-vod-chat.streamlit.app/).
3. Wait for data processing, might take a while.
4. Make adjustments you want. Hover the chart to see message preview. Check top table from bottom of the page.

# Are there any proper instructions?

Not yet no. Try to play around with a small file (less than 100KB) and move on to bigger ones when you get the gist of it.
